This package consists of a python script to calculate LaTeX settings for 
arbitrary font and page sizes, helpful when producing documents for 
people with low vision.  Compatible with any other LaTeX package and 
avoids the usual drawbacks of giant print (less weight in the font etc) 
by taking the approach of typesetting on small paper and then using 
magstep.  Can also help for typesetting posters.
